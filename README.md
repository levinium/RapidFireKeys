Note: RapidFireKeys launches in the system tray and can be managed from there.


GUIDE:

To customize what applications RapidFireKeys works for and what hotkeys are rapid-fired, edit the CONFIG.json file located in the RapidFireKeys.exe directory.

Here is an example CONFIG.json file that runs for D2R.exe (Diablo II Resurrected game), and "OtherApp.exe" (some other application)

A key that has "modifiers" defined will only rapid-fire while those modifier keys are also pressed; for example in D2R.exe, Left Mouse Button will only rapid-fire while Shift is also held down.

Example CONFIG.json:
```
{
    "D2R.exe": [
        { "key": "LButton", "modifiers": ["Shift"] },
        { "key": "RButton" },
        { "key": "MButton"},
        { "key": "XButton1"},
        { "key": "XButton2"},
        { "key": "Back"},
        { "key": "Q" },
        { "key": "W" },
        { "key": "E" },
        { "key": "R" },
        { "key": "A" },
        { "key": "S" },
        { "key": "D" },
        { "key": "F" },
        { "key": "G" },
        { "key": "H" },
        { "key": "B" }
    ],
    "OtherApp.exe": [
       { "key": "LButton", "modifiers": ["Shift", "Ctrl", "Alt"] },
       { "key": "RButton" },
    ]
}
```
